# get all the html for the quotes



# use beautiful soup to loop through each quote and create a list of dictionary, each dictionary being a quote along with all the details about that particular thought


# Choose one dictionary(quote) randomly from the list


# prompt the user to guess who this quote is from


# decrease a counter for every wrong guess


# After each wrong guess, reach out to the author bio page (through the bio link stored in the dictionary) and give hints

# If user guesses incorrectly to the end, end game and give them the answer, also ask if they would like to play again, choose another random quote and start again

# If user guesses correctly within the allowed 4 guesses, stop the game, inform the user that they have won and prompt them if they would like to play again.
