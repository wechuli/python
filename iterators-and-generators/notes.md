# Iterators and Generators

- Define iterator and iterable
- Understand the iter() and next() methods
- Build custom for loop
- Define what generators are and how they can be used
- compare generator functions and generator expressions
- use generatoes to pause execution of expesinve functions

## Iterator

An object that can be iterated upon. An object which returns data, one element at a time when next() is called on it

## Iterable

An object which will return an iterator when iter() is called on it

## NEXT

When next() is called on an iterator, the iterator returns the next item. It keeps doing so until it raises a StopIteration error
