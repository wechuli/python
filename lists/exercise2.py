# Exercise 4: Download a copy of the file from www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt
# Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line,
# split the line into a list of words using the split function.
# For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in
# the list, add it to the list.
# When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical
# order.
# Enter file: romeo.txt
# ['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already',
# 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief',
# 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft',
# 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window',
# 'with', 'yonder']
