After the Funeral
by Kelly Roper

The funeral is over,
And everyone has gone home.
It's just me and my thoughts now,
And I'm sitting here alone.

Woman holding a rose at a burial
The house seems so quiet,
and I'm not sure what to do.
I can't remember how I lived
Before the day that I met you.

Maybe I should just stop thinking.
And take myself to bed.
I'll crawl beneath the covers,
And lay down my weary head.

Tomorrow is a new day,
The first of many that I'll face
Without you here beside me,
Without your strength, your wit, your grace.

I'll try to carry on
Or at least I'll try to exist.
Until one day you reach for me,
And guide me into death's mist.
