#Polymorphism is a key principle in OOP which is the idea that an object can take on many(poly) forms(morph).

# 1. Thesame class method works  in a similar way for different classes - A common implementation of this is to have a method in a base (or parent) class that is overriden by a subclass. This is called method overriding, each subclass will have a different implementation of the method
# 2. The same operation works for different kinds of objects
